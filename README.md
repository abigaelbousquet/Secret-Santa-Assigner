# Secret-Santa-Assigner

I designed this program because every year my immediate family of 5 does a Secret Santa gift exchange for Christmas and we inevitably ALWAYS have issues with generating everyone's assignments. Whether it is having to re-pick 3+ times because someone is left drawing themselves or someone is double picked and someone not at all (like this year when we tried to make drawings over Facetime while I was away at college), the old fashioned pick-from-a-hat method has failed us.

I hope that this program can help our family and many others (immediate families, extended families, work families, etc) to have easy, stress-free Secret Santa assignments so that they can focus on the fun of the tradition instead of chaotic technical difficulties.

Ultimately, I would like the Setup tab to take each Santa's name AND phone number and the Assignments tab to be replaced by a feature that would distribute everyone's assignments via an automated text to the phone number on file for ultimate secrecy, maybe along with a reminder of the gift $ limit.

***This was my first project using Intellij & Maven JavaFX, so there were extra files added by Intellij that I wasn't sure if they were needed or not; I uploaded everything just to be safe.

Thank you for reading! Have a wonderful day! :)
